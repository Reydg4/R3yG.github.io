        to walk around because of something and we ended up having a little photo shoot on these steps
        on the left side of Polaris. All I could think was, man this girls cute and I'm way shorter then her. 
        Little did I know this would be the girl of my dreams.

    <h3 class = "text"> March 20, 2021 (Logan, Hawking Hills area) 3:06pm ~ This was scary. You kept going into
        every little space you could fit and I'm just trying to keep up. I'm not going to tell you sto stop though.
        I had to impress this cute girl and show her I can keep up with her adventurous side!

    <h3 class = "text"> April 3, 2021 (Homestead Park) 2:54pm ~ Riding bikes was super fun but it's like that terrible
        weather made us both agree that it wasn't for us. We should do it once summer comes back! I remember that 
        huge field and the cute house you pointed out. I can't wait to get a cute house with you.

        keep goign there and making more memories with you! This is definitly one of my favorite pictures :)

        just right. You look stunning! Remember how frustrated you got because we didn't have a map? And then I got us a map!
        And all I heard was put that back Rey! This was a fun trip, and we definitly need to go to a zoo soon.

    <h3 class = "text"> August 22, 2021 (???) 11:41am ~ I have no clue where this is, but we rode canoes and it was really nice
        and just super peaceful. I would love to stay at a place near that river and just be able to go out and swim in that water 
        all day! This was a great idea and I had tons of fun!
